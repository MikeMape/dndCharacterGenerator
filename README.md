# dndCharacterGenerator
stat roller for dungeons and dragons 5e.
 The file will prompt you asking what you'd like to do. If you type in "rollstat" then it will generate four random numbers between one and six 
simulating rolling four d6 dice.
 It will then ask you which ability you want that score to represent. You can choose between:
 Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. 
 If you type anything other than rollstat, then it will display your current stats.
 I plan on adding more features as I become more proficient with python. Thank you!
